# Next Tutorial

Hi fellow developer

My name is Alex, I built this tutorial a while ago when I worked on the team that developed it.

To my best knowledge, **Next UI is no longer actively maintained**. I will keep this repository as a monument of work I've done, but I'd like to set an expectation that **any new issues or pull requests will be ignored**.

In case you would like to obtain more details, I highly recommend going to [the DevNet website](https://developer.cisco.com/) for any information. At the time of writing this disclaimer this link worked to start a Webex Teams chat with the DevNet team:  [click here](https://developer.cisco.com/site/spark-chat/)
