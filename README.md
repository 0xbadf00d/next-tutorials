# NeXt UI Documentation

## DISCLAIMER / As of 25th November 2019

Hi fellow developer

My name is Alex, I built this tutorial a while ago when I worked on the team that developed Next.

To my best knowledge, **Next UI is no longer actively maintained**. I will keep this repository as a monument of work I've done, but I'd like to set an expectation that **any new issues or pull requests will be ignored**.

In case you would like to obtain more details, I highly recommend going to [the DevNet website](https://developer.cisco.com/) for any information. At the time of writing this disclaimer this link worked to start a Webex Teams chat with the DevNet team:  [click here](https://developer.cisco.com/site/spark-chat/).

## Introduction

This is the tutorial to help you understand how NeXt UI Toolkit works and start writing your code as soon as possible.

Should you notice a typo or have a question, do not hesitate to contact the authors at <next-dev@lists.opendaylight.org>.

**Please, note:** we appreciate sharing code snippets (instead of verbal description of an encountered issue). See [guide](./tutorials/code-snippet-publishing-guide.md).

## NeXt + AngularJS
As we say, NeXt pairs well with AngularJS. No tutorials are available for this awesome duo at the moment, but you may want to check out our portfolio in the [Introduction](tutorials/tutorial-000.md), since it has several AngularJS+NeXt apps.
