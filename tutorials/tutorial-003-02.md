# Layers
Layers are the containers for homogeneous objects. For instance, the built-in layers include nodes', links', paths' and other layers. You may need them for mass operations (like *clear path layer* to wipe all the paths out the screen), or to iterate all object in the layer: e.g. spin each node round.

## Built-in layers
TBD: generate table
