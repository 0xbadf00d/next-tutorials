# Layouts
Layouts describe the way the nodes are spead out on the screen. For example, NeXt has a built-in layout called *auto layout* (which is also related to the "*force*" data processor). It always helps you when you do not want to specify exact location of each node, but you'd like NeXt to take care of that. The data processor and layout do all job for you.
