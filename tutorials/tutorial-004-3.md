# Inheritance in Classes
Now you ended up knowing the way to define a class (```nx.define```) and the way to make up properties and methods. That's cool, but what how do you reuse an existing class? 

In NeXt you'll need this all the time. Let's imagine, you're OK with the way NeXt works with nodes, except for a single method, and that's where you need inheritance: you keep all the "parent" members of class (properties and methods) and then rewrite merely one method instead of rewriting the whole thing. It's a wise way, isn't it?

## Inherit a Simple Class
### Rewrite Constructor


### Keep Constructor Partitially
