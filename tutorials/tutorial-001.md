# Tutorial #1: Setup Framework
Hi! Welcome to NeXt tutorial #1. We are here to let you understand NeXt UI and help you start writing your code as soon as possible. We are making the tutorials as short and simple as possible to let you marsh step by step and monitor your progress after each step.

Okay, why don't we start right away?

## Setup
### Setup with NPM or Bower
[NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) is a package manager, which allows you to download prepared (distributable) versions of JavaScript software for [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/). [Bower](http://bower.io/) has the same idea: it is "package manager for the web". In other words, this tool allows you to download JavaScript stuff from a repository. 

### Manual Setup
First of all, download latest NeXt UI release from [Cisco DevNet web-site](https://developer.cisco.com/site/neXt/). Extract the files from archive and move them to a place, which is convenient to you. 

Create an HTML page. Link CSS and JS files to your project.
